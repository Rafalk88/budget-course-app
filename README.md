## :mortar_board:What I learned on this course

1. Built a home budget management app with the ability to add transactions and assign them to specific budgeted categories.
2. Technical aspects covered:  
   a. Styling components using `CSS-in-JS` with `styled-components`.  
   b. Managing application state with `Redux` and understanding how middleware works and how to create them (e.g., notify middleware with `Toastify`). 
   c. Using `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks to improve application performance.  
   d. Built a modal (for adding transactions) using `React Portals`.  
   e. Utilized `React Suspense` (loading indicator) and `React Lazy` for code-splitting.  
   f. Used `React.memo` to reduce unnecessary component re-renders.  
   g. Integrated a form using `React Hook Form`.  
   h. Replaced `Redux` state management with `React Query`, where data is cached (added middleware to `JSON Server` for caching enforcement, currently disabled).  
   i. Replaced `Redux` with `Context API`, where two approaches were applied: first with `useState`, and later replaced with `useReducer`.  
   j. Used `JSON Server` for API interactions.
